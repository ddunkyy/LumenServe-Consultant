You can find executable file (LS Full.exe) in the 'dist' folder.

Before running this program, please make sure the following requirements met:
1) You have downloaded and unziped the compatible 'chromedriver' and please set it in your default download folder. If you don't have 'chromedriver' on your computer, please follow this link (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) and download the version that match your Google Chrome version (you can check this at the 3-dot menu on the top right corner, look for 'Help', and 'About Google Chrome').

2) Make sure when you open the 'dist' folder, there is an Excel file called 'Holy Grail Target Twrs 2020 08 25'. This is a modified version of the original file you gave us. DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE!

Now you have met the above requirements, double-click on the 'LS Full.exe' file in the 'dist' folder. 

You will see that nothing happens right away, you check if the program is running by opening the Task Manager.

There will be a small pop-up window asking you to select your download folder, CRM email, and CRM password. Make sure when you pick the download folder, it should be in the same folder as the 'chromedriver'. Then click 'sumbit' and CLOSE THIS WINDOW for the program to continue.

There will be more pop-up windows along the way, please do not interact or minimize it until the program finished. If you have to do something else with your computer, please set whatever you are doing on top of these windows.

There will be a final pop-up window tells you that the whole program has completed. When you see this you can close every windows and check for results in the 'dist' folder.

After every run, we recommend you to open the download folder again and delete any file that was downloaded by the program.

Thank you for using our product!
